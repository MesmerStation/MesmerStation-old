  Originating from the nuclear wastelands of earth, mutants sometimes choose to emigrate to the Republic of Santia to escape the deadly conditions of the wastelands. 
  They face many difficulties in Santian society, having to hide their true identity unless they wish to be viewed with suspicion or disdain, but it is an improvement from their previous home. Some are able to easily pass as standard humans, but others are more visibly mutated due to the markings on their skin. However, no mutant can completely pass as a standard human, since all mutants have four nipples and great resistance to radiation.
  Being the children of the nuclear holocaust, they have their own myths and legends as to how it happened and why, ranging from the wrath of an angry god to the greed of a megacorporation. To keep these stories alive and to find solidarity amongst each other, mutants often stick together in their own societal conclaves, much to the dismay of the state.
