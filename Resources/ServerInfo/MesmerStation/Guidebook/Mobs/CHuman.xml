  Humans who have been designated to work or live for long periods of time in space are legally required to recieve cybernetic enhancements. These cybernetic humans are most easily identified by their robotic legs, arms, and spines, but they may also have other augmentations that aren't immediately obvious.
  Despite being more physically equipped to live in space, there is no real way to mentally equip someone for life in space without removing the mind altogether. As such, cybernetic humans tend to be more susceptible to spaceborn mental illnesses. The vast majority of cybernetic humans suffer no longterm consequences of their augmentations and lifestyle, but others become erratic or depressed over time. Some forget who they are, thinking only of the job, and an unlucky few forget their humanity entirely.
